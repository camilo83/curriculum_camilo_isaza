          This project involves the development of an innovative e-commerce
          website for Superkaskos, a prominent company based in Medell√≠n. The
          platform is designed to provide an exceptional user experience,
          allowing customers to easily browse and purchase helmets. It also
          features advanced functionalities for admin profiles, enabling
          real-time product information updates. This project marks my debut as
          a Full Stack developer, showcasing my ability to integrate frontend
          and backend solutions efficiently.
